# Budget Manager

This is an app built using React and Bootstrap with Vite. The app allows the user to view, add, edit, and delete their budgets. However, the new data input by the user does not persist after refreshing. In future iterations, the app can be improved by allowing users to set a defined time period for their budgets, e.g. a month.

## Features
```bash
The app includes the following features:

View all budgets and their expenditures
Add a new budget or expenditure
Edit an existing budget or expenditure
Delete a budget
```


## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
npm run build
```
